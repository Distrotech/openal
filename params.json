{"name":"Openal","tagline":"","body":"Source Install\r\n==============\r\n\r\nTo install OpenAL Soft, use your favorite shell to go into the build/\r\ndirectory, and run:\r\n\r\ncmake ..\r\n\r\nAssuming configuration went well, you can then build it, typically using GNU\r\nMake (KDevelop, MSVC, and others are possible depending on your system setup\r\nand CMake configuration).\r\n\r\nPlease Note: Double check that the appropriate backends were detected. Often,\r\ncomplaints of no sound, crashing, and missing devices can be solved by making\r\nsure the correct backends are being used. CMake's output will identify which\r\nbackends were enabled.\r\n\r\nFor most systems, you will likely want to make sure ALSA, OSS, and PulseAudio\r\nwere detected (if your target system uses them). For Windows, make sure\r\nDirectSound was detected.\r\n\r\n\r\nUtilities\r\n=========\r\n\r\nThe source package comes with an informational utility, openal-info, and is\r\nbuilt by default. It prints out information provided by the ALC and AL sub-\r\nsystems, including discovered devices, version information, and extensions.\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration\r\n=============\r\n\r\nOpenAL Soft can be configured on a per-user and per-system basis. This allows\r\nusers and sysadmins to control information provided to applications, as well\r\nas application-agnostic behavior of the library. See alsoftrc.sample for\r\navailable settings.\r\n\r\n\r\nAcknowledgements\r\n================\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks go to:\r\n\r\nCreative Labs for the original source code this is based off of.\r\n\r\nChristopher Fitzgerald for the current reverb effect implementation, and\r\nhelping with the low-pass filter.\r\n\r\nChristian Borss for the 3D panning code the current implementation is heavilly\r\nbased on.\r\n\r\nBen Davis for the idea behind the current click-removal code.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
